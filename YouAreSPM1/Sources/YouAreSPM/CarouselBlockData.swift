                Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è! You can call me Piggy üê∑!

                Pig is how I symbolize myself: it's cute but easily influenced by others. I used to define myself by what others thought I should be. I used to be an obedient daughter who would do things for my parents even when I didn't want to, always putting their wishes first.

                Everything changed when I went to college. I reflected on myself and realized my own expectations contradicted my parents' wishes. They expected me to live near them and fully care for them when they grew old. But I wanted to have my own business. I didn't want to remain the "cute pig" who did nothing but stay near my parents. I wanted to be strong and independent. So I changed...

                I know how hard it is to follow your own desires, especially if you're too influenced by others. The reason I built this app is because I realized how important it is to note down evidence that supports your goals. Being yourself requires encouragement and support. Most of the time, others can't fully be there for you.

                This app helps you keep track of each step you take toward your goal. Whenever you feel sad, discouraged, or doubtful about yourself, open this app‚Äîit will provide everything you need.
